# ML-_Project
Job Market Analysis and Salary Prediction for Data Scientists An end-to-end machine learning project that analyzes data science job market trends and predicts salaries using regression and ensemble models. Includes EDA, model comparison, hyperparameter tuning, and deployment with Streamlit.

Objectives

Analyze data science job postings to identify market trends

Understand the impact of experience, employment type, and company size on salary

Build and compare multiple regression models for salary prediction

Select the best-performing model using evaluation metrics

Deploy the final model using Streamlit for real-time predictions
